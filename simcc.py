Serial Interactive Meshtastic Chat Client 0.1.0

def onReceive(packet=None, interface=None):
    """
    Callback function to process an incoming text message when the topic
    "meshtastic.receive.text" is published.

    This function accepts both 'packet' and 'interface' as optional parameters
    to avoid errors from extra keyword arguments. When the Meshtastic library
    publishes on the "meshtastic.receive.text" topic, it may include an
    'interface' argument along with 'packet'; by default, PyPubSub can raise
    errors if it encounters unexpected keywords.

    Parameters:
        packet (dict, optional): A dictionary containing data about the received
            packet. Defaults to None if no packet info is supplied.
            If present, it may include:
              - 'decoded': A dictionary that may contain a 'text' key if the
                          packet is a text message.
              - 'fromId': (Optional) The identifier of the sender. If missing,
                          defaults to "unknown".
        interface (optional): The Meshtastic interface instance that received
            the packet (provided by the publisher). Unused here, but accepted
            to avoid pubsub errors.

    Side Effects:
        - If the packet contains a text message (under 'decoded.text'), it
          prints the sender ID and the message to standard output.
        - Prints a prompt ("Ch0> ") to indicate that further user
          input can be entered.

    Returns:
        None
            This function does not return anything. It processes the packet
            for display and updates the console prompt.

async def main():
    """
    Main asynchronous entry point for the serial chat client.

    Steps:
      1. Reads the serial port (e.g., /dev/cu.usbserial-0001) from the command line.
      2. Creates a SerialInterface for that port (auto-connect).
      3. Waits briefly to stabilize the connection.
      4. Subscribes to incoming text messages (via onReceive).
      5. Enters an interactive loop reading user input and sending messages on
         channelIndex=0, labeled as "Ch0> ".
      6. Closes the interface upon Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt).

    Usage:
        python simcc.py <SERIAL_PORT>

    Raises:
        Exception: If the serial connection fails to initialize.

    Side Effects:
        - Prints debug/info messages about the connection process.
        - Prompts for user input with "Ch0>" to send messages.
        - Exits gracefully on Ctrl+C.

    Returns:
        None
